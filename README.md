# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### SUMMARY

In Season 1 you met the API Rangers, a group of coders with attitude. Now Season 2 brings you a new group of coders with even more attitude, otherwise known as Ben, Kai, Yingying and Guy. 

This is the front-end for the BNTA Spotify Clone backend project, tt is an APP that works similarly to Spotify, where you can find songs by searching by song name or filter by genre. You can create multiple playlists with your favourite songs. 


### STEP-BY-STEP SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Clone this repository : git clone git@github.com:bendesousa/frontend_project_group4.git

2. cd into the repository you have just cloned and run an 'npm install' in the terminal 

3. Open the server-side repo backend-project in IntelliJ and run the SpringBoot application

4. the server port should configure to 8080 by default
   Open the client-side repo frontend-project in Visual Studio Code

5. Run the front-end application using npm start where it should run the application on localhost:3000

6. Double check you are not running the production build by checking the console log in your browser telling you to make sure the server is running on        port 8080



### PROJECT STRUCTURE/DESCRIPTION

#### Personal Playlists

-User can create multiple playlists
-User can add any song they wish from the database into their playlist with the click of a button
