# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## BNTA SPOTIFY CLONE FRONT-END PROJECT

### TABLE OF CONTENTS

### SUMMARY

This is the front-end for the BNTA Spotify Clone backend project which was produced by the API Rangers otherwise known as Faizan, Hasmeet, Joao and Milo. It is an APP that works similarly to 


### STEP-BY-STEP SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Clone this repository : git clone git@github.com:bendesousa/frontend_project_group4.git

2. Open the server-side repo backend-project in IntelliJ and run the SpringBoot application

the server port should configure to 8080 by default
Open the client-side repo frontend-project in Visual Studio Code and run npm install to install the required node modules

Run the front-end application using npm start where it should run the application on localhost:3000

Double check you are not running the production build by checking the console log in your browser telling you to make sure the server is running on port 8080
